## Artificial Intelligence

### Brief Hisroty

- Symbolic AI
- Neural AI
- Statistical AI

### Early AI Programs

- Checkers Player: **lookahead search**
- Newell & Simonâ€™s Logic Theorist: **search tree and heuristics search**

### Birth of AI

**Workshop at Dartmouth College**

- Name "Artificial Intelligence" for the new field

### First AI Winter

- Underwhelming results
    - Machine Translation

- Problems
    - **Limited computation**: search space grew **exponentially**, outpacing hardware
    - **Limited information**: complexity of AI problems

### Knowledge-based Systems

- Expert systems
    - Encode prior knowledge to **reduce computation**

> Deterministic rules could not handle the uncertainty of the real world.

### Neural Networks

- CNN
- backpropagation id popluar
- Recognizing handwritten digits for USPS
    - consider AI tools, not to make a "real human"
- AlexNet
- AlphaGo
    - deep reinforcement learning, MCTS
- Bayesian Networks
    - graphical models, reasoning under uncertainty
- Support Vector Machines
    - Find the best by optimization algorithm! 

### AI Methods

- Search
- Symbolic AI
- Nerual AI
- Statistical AI
- Communicating, Perceiving, Acting

## Two Views of AI

### Two Views

- Intelligence Agent
    - how can we create intelligence
- AI Tools
    - how can we benefit society

### AI Tools

**AI + Science**

## AI Advances
