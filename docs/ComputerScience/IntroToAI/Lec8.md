## Autoencoders

- Want features to capture meaningful factors of variation in data.

**Unsuprevised Pre-training**

- Fine-tune
    - small learning rate in the encoder part

### Sparse Autoencoders

- Capture the factors with the property of sparsity

### Denoising Autoencoders

The denoising autoencoder (DAE) is an autoencoder that receives a corrupted data point as input and is trained to predict the original, uncorrupted data point as its output.

- Manifold Learning

## Convolutional Neural Network

- Cross-Corrleation (sliding inner product)
